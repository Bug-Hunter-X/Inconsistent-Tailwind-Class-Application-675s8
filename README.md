# Inconsistent Tailwind Class Application

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves Tailwind classes seemingly being ignored or applied incorrectly, leading to unexpected styling inconsistencies across different components or even within the same component, sometimes in a seemingly random manner.

The bug is intermittent. Sometimes Tailwind classes work perfectly while other times the exact same classes are completely ignored.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that Tailwind classes, applied using standard methods, fail to produce the expected styling. This occurs unexpectedly, making debugging challenging. The bug may appear across various components or even parts of the same component, depending on the circumstances, resulting in unexpected styling or absence of styles where they should be.

## How to Reproduce

Clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run the application. You might need to adjust the run command based on your setup (e.g., `npm run dev` or `npm start`).
3. Observe the styling of the components.  You will see inconsistencies in how the Tailwind classes are applied, with the issue happening intermittently.
